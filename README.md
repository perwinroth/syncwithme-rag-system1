# SyncWithMe RAG System

🧠 **Global Travel Intelligence with Dual RAG Architecture**

A production-ready RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that provides specific, honest travel recommendations worldwide instead of generic responses.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Global Coverage**: 15+ countries with real venue recommendations
- **Honest Responses**: Returns "not available" instead of false positives
- **Multi-language**: English, Swedish, Spanish support
- **Dual RAG**: Intent extraction + success pattern matching
- **Persistent Server**: Express.js for reliable performance vs serverless limitations

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

**Before**: 20% accuracy, generic "Museum Visits" responses  
**After**: Specific venues with addresses, prices, and booking details

### Examples

**Positive Response**:
```
Query: "broke students tokyo nightlife"
Response: "Golden Gai, Shinjuku, ¥500-1000 drinks, tiny bars. Robot Restaurant, Kabukicho, ¥8000 show..."
```

**Negative Response**:
```
Query: "vegan ice cream antarctica"  
Response: "Sorry, no vegan ice cream shops in Antarctica. Closest options in Ushuaia, Argentina..."
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Vector Database**: Pinecone (2048 dimensions)
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-large
- **Patterns**: 33 success patterns, 36 language patterns
- **Coverage**: Positive/negative/mixed response types
